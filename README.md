# securecart
Create a simple PHP shopping cart application that uses an array to add any item (without price) to the cart.  Allow the user to type anything into a text input and simply add it to the cart.  Display the cart's contents below the form.  Use a single page that posts back to itself.

The user must login, using a secure (hashed) password that is stored in the database, before they can access the shopping cart.
